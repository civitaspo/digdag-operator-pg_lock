A digdag plugin to run digdag tasks with locks by PostgreSQL.

# Overview

- Plugin type: operator

# Usage

```yaml
_export:
  plugin:
    repositories:
      - https://jitpack.io
    dependencies:
      - pro.civitaspo:digdag-operator-pg_lock:0.0.1.pre3

+lock-with:
  # Wait during 5m until getting the named lock if another task locks.
  # This named lock can be used beyond the workflow and the project,
  # that means if another task in another project locks by the name, this task waits until the lock is released.
  pg_lock>: lock-1
  wait_timeout: 5m
  _do:
    echo>: hello world

+control-parallelism:
  # Tasks can get 5 locks.
  # When parallel tasks run with this feature, you can control the parallelism.
  # The below example means the tasks run in 5 parallels.
  loop>: 100
  _parallel: true
  _do:
    pg_lock>: lock-2  
    limit: 5
    _do:
      echo>: hello world
```

See [example](./example).

# Configuration

## Remarks

- type `DurationParam` is strings matched `\s*(?:(?<days>\d+)\s*d)?\s*(?:(?<hours>\d+)\s*h)?\s*(?:(?<minutes>\d+)\s*m)?\s*(?:(?<seconds>\d+)\s*
s)?\s*`.
  - The strings is used as `java.time.Duration`.
  
## System configurations

- **pg_lock.host**: The host name of PostgreSQL. (string, required)
- **pg_lock.port**: The port of PostgreSQL. (integer, default: `5432`)
- **pg_lock.database**: The database name of PostgreSQL. (string, required)
- **pg_lock.schemata**: The schema (or several schemata separated by commas) to be set in the search-path. (string, default: `"public"`)
- **pg_lock.user**: The user name of PostgreSQL. (string, required)
- **pg_lock.password**: The password of PostgreSQL. (string, optional)
- **pg_lock.login_timeout**: The timeout duration to wait for establishment of a PostgreSQL database connection. (`DurationParam`, default: `30s`)
- **pg_lock.socket_timeout**: The timeout duration for socket read operations. If reading from the server takes longer than this value, the connection is closed. This can be used as both a brute force global query timeout and a method of detecting network problems. `0s` means that it is disabled. (`DurationParam`, default: `30m`)
- **pg_lock.ssl**: (boolean, default: `false`)
- **pg_lock.connection_timeout**: The timeout duration that a client will wait for a connection from the pool. If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, a `SQLException` will be thrown. (`DurationParam`, default: `30s`)
- **pg_lock.idle_timeout**: The timeout duration that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. `0s` means that idle connections are never removed from the pool. (`DurationParam`, default: `10m`)
- **pg_lock.validation_timeout**: The timeout duration that the pool will wait for a connection to be validated as alive. (`DurationParam`, default: `5s`)
- **pg_lock.max_pool_size**: The connection pool size that is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections. (integer, default: `5`)
- **pg_lock.min_idle_size**: The property controls the minimum number of idle connections in the pool. (integer, default: the same value as **pg_lock.max_pool_size**)
- **pg_lock.max_life_time**: This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. When a connection reaches this timeout, even if recently used, it will be retired from the pool. An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is idle will it be removed. (`DurationParam`, default: `30m`)
- **pg_lock.leak_detection_threshold**: The threshold that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak. `0s` means that it is disabled. (`DurationParam`, default: `0s`)
- **pg_lock.poll_interval**: The polling interval to wait for getting the named lock. (`DurationParam`, default: `5s`)
- **pg_lock.min_poll_interval**: The minimum polling interval to wait for getting the named lock. (`DurationParam`, default: `5s`)
- **pg_lock.max_poll_interval**: The maximum polling interval to wait for getting the named lock. (`DurationParam`, default: `5m`)
- **pg_lock.schema_migration**: Whether do schema migration or not. (boolean, default: `true`)
- **pg_loch.schema_migration_history_table**: The table name to write schema migration history. (string, default: `"pg_lock_schema_migrations"`)
- **pg_lock.hash_seed_for_advisory_lock**: The seed to hash strings with "MurmurHash 3" algorithm for `pg_try_advisory_lock`. (integer, default: `-137723950` (the same as `scala.util.hashing.MurmurHash3.stringSeed`))


## Operator configurations

- **pg_lock>**: The name of lock. This name is used across workflows and projects. (string, required)
- **wait_timeout**: The timeout to wait for getting the named lock. (`DurationParam`, default: `15m`)
- **expire_in**: The duration that the named lock expires in. (`DurationParam`, default: `"1h"`)
- **limit**: The limit count of the named locks within the namespace. If the different value is defined in another task, throw `ConfigException`. (integer, default: `1`) 
- **namespace**: The namespace that the named lock can be unique. The valid values are `"global"`, `"site"`, `"project"`, `"workflow"`, `"session"`, and`"attempt"`. (string, default: `"site"`)
- **_do**: The definition of subtasks with the named lock. (config, required) 


# Warnings

* When you cancel the tasks inside `_do` of `pg_lock>`, you must wait for the release of the lock until the expiration. So, I recommend you to set the `expire_in` duration as short as possible.
    * This problem is resolved by [treasure-data/digdag \[feature request\] `_canceled` parameter for some cleanup tasks #1226](https://github.com/treasure-data/digdag/issues/1226).
    * You can unlock the lock forcibly by using the internal operator `pg_unlock`. You need to find the lock ID from the log. This operator is used internally, so be careful when using it as changes that are not backward compatible may be made. See the [PgUnlockOperator implementation](./src/main/scala/pro/civitaspo/digdag/plugin/pg_lock/unlock/PgUnlockOperator.scala).
      ```yaml
      +unlock-forcibly:
        pg_unlock>: ${the lock ID}
        force: true
      ```
* This plugin close connections in `PgLockPgConnectionPooler#finalize()`, so the number of connections does not necessarily exceed value of **pg_lock.max_pool_size**.
